# Multivariate Time-series Data
In this GitHub repo, we provide a data set that could be used for research related to the multivariate time series signals. MIXm1 dataset contains the number of people in different regions. The detailed description is as follows.


### MIXm1
The raw data is in [Question B of the "Teddy Cup" Data Analysis Skills Competition](https://www.tipdm.org:10010/#/competition/1352509890509332480/question). It contains the students' consumption records in April 2019, which are sampled every 10 minutes from 33 regions on the campus.

 A demo slice of the MIXm1 data is illustrated in the following figure.
